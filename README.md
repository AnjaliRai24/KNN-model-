# KNN-model-
Developed a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) model to classify glass types based on chemical composition and refractive index. Includes data preprocessing, visualization, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1), and decision boundary visualization using Python and scikit-learn.
